# Los Gatos

This is a sample app to explore the new UI controls and features present in Xamarin.Forms 5.0 and the new Xamarin Community Toolkit (XCT).

* CarouselView bundled inside the TabView from the XCT
* Brushes for linear gradients
* Drag & Drop for moving products to the shopping cart
* RadioButton with control templates for settings
* Shapes for clipping and drawing
* SwipeView for acting on the shopping cart items

Also includes:

* Resizetizer for turning SVGs into PNGs at all the densities
* Sharpnado Shadows for...shadows
* Shared Transitions for animation from the popular cards to the details page
* Essentials to get the screen width and density for drawing
* MvvmHelpers for ... help
* Tiny Messenger to message between views and models

Several pages are incomplete at this time. Feel free to take a run at implementing any design you like while exploring Xamarin.Forms 5.0! I'll continue doing the same.
